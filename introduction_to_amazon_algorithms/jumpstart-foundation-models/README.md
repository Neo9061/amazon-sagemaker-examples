# Amazon SageMaker Examples

### JumpStart Foundation Models

These examples provide quick walkthroughs to get you up and running with Amazon SageMaker JumpStart Foundation Models.

- [Text2Text Generation Flan T5](text2text-generation-flan-t5.ipynb) demonstrates Text2Text generation using state-of-the-art pretrained Flan T5 models from [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/flan-t5) which take an input text containing the task and returns the output of the accomplished task.
- [Text Generation Few Shot Learning](text-generation-few-shot-learning.ipynb) demonstrates Text generation using state-of-the-art pretrained GPT-J-6B models from [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/EleutherAI/gpt-j-6B) which takes a text string as input and predicts a sequence of next few words. These models can, for example, fill in incomplete text or paraphrase.
